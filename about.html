    <h1 class="name">About Me</h1>
    <p>I’m Adab Singh Malhi — currently studying at Chitkara University with a deep-rooted passion for building, solving, and understanding how things work. I’m the kind of person who doesn’t just follow instructions — I ask why, explore the how, and then figure out how to make it better.</p>
    <p>Right now, I’m diving into Data Structures and Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, and Web Development, building projects that merge logic with creativity. I’m also deeply passionate about STEM — from the elegance of mathematics to the innovation in tech and engineering, it’s the world I think in and thrive in.</p>
    <p>Beyond the screen, I’ve always believed in sharpening the mind and body. I’ve played golf for years, a game that taught me precision, patience, and mental control. I also enjoy chess, where strategy meets foresight, and football, which brings out my competitive side and love for teamwork.</p>
    <p>For me, this journey isn’t about ticking boxes — it’s about mastering skills, solving real problems, and creating things that make a difference. I'm here to think smarter, build better, and stay three steps ahead.</p>
