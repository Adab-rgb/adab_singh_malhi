    <h2 class="hobby">CHESS</h2>
    <div class ="chess">

        <p>Chess isn’t just a hobby for me — it’s a mental discipline. I’m drawn to the strategy, foresight, and calculated risk it demands. Every move matters, every decision reveals something about your mindset. Playing chess has sharpened my ability to think several steps ahead, stay calm under pressure, and approach problems with clarity and logic — qualities I bring into everything I do, from coding to real-world decision-making.</p>

    <h2 class="hobby">GOLF</h2>
    <div class="golf">
        <p>I used to play golf professionally, competing up to the North Zone level. Though I didn’t take the win there, the experience shaped how I approach everything in life — with focus, patience, and discipline. Golf taught me to stay composed under pressure, to refine technique through repetition, and to always respect the process. Today, it’s more of a hobby, but the mindset it built remains a core part of who I am.</p>

    <h2 class="hobby"> FOOTBALL</h2>
    <div class="Soccer">
        <img src="./capshot/pics/suiiiiiiiiii.webp" alt="">
        <p>Football has always been more than a game to me — it’s where passion meets persistence. Like Jamie Vardy, I’ve never relied on shortcuts or privilege — just energy, grit, and an obsession with improving. Playing football has taught me to move with intent, think fast under pressure, and always back myself, even when the odds aren’t ideal. Whether it's a casual match or a competitive setup, I bring intensity, drive, and a hunger to win every time I step on the pitch.
